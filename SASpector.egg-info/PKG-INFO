        A bioinformatics tool to extract and analyze missing regions of short-read assemblies by mapping the contigs to a reference genome.
        
        ## Introduction
        
        SASpector is a tool that compares a short-reads assembly with a reference bacterial genome (for example obtained via hybrid assembly) by extracting missing (unmapped) regions from the reference and analyzing them to see functional and compositional pattern. The aim of the analysis is to explain why these regions are missed by the short-read assembly and if important parts of the genome are missed when a resolved genome is lacking.
        
        The tool takes as global inputs the reference genome and a short-read assembly as contigs/draft genome, both in FASTA format. This repository contains a command-line tool `SASpector` to obtain missing regions and several script for evaluation
        and analysis for those missing regions:
        
        - `SASpectorcheck`: checks if the third-party tools used by SASpector are installed in the system.
        - `mapper.py`: mapping of the short-reads assembly against the reference assembly using progressiveMauve (Mauve aligner).
        - `summary.py`: extraction of the mapped, unmapped (missing) and conflict regions to FASTA files. Also, creates summary statistic for the missing regions and reference which are written to separate tab-delimited files.
        - `gene_predict.py`: prediction of genes in the missing regions using Prokka. Optionally, run BLASTX to the predicted genes with an user-defined protein database in FASTA file. In this repository you can find protein database retrieved from UniprotKB for bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus subtillis and Staphylococcus aureus.
        
        Optionally, some scripts provide additional analysis:
        
        - `kmer.py`: extraction of kmers and tandem repeats in the missing regions. Additionally, performs a pairwise comparison between kmers of missing and mapped regions using Sourmash.
        - `coverage.py`: calculates the average coverage of the missing and mapped regions with a provided BED file.
        - `quastunmap.py`: performs a genome quality assessment for the missing regions to the reference and provides a genome viewer using QUAST and Icarus.

        For basic functionalities, run `SASpector`:
        
        ```
        usage: SASpector - Short-read Assembly inSpector [-h] [-p PREFIX]
                                                         [-dir OUTDIR] [-f [LENGTH]]
                                                         [-db [PROTEIN-DB]] [-k [K]]
                                                         [-q] [-c [BAMFILE]]
                                                         reference contigs
        
        positional arguments:
          reference             Reference genome FASTA file, e.g. from hybrid
                                assembly. If the file contains multiple seqences, only
                                the first one is used, so make sure to concatenate if
                                needed.
          contigs               Short-read assembly FASTA file as contigs/draft genome.
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -p PREFIX, --prefix PREFIX
                                Genome ID
          -dir OUTDIR, --outdir OUTDIR
                                Output directory
          -f [LENGTH], --flanking [LENGTH]
                                Add flanking regions to the extracted missing regions
                                [Default = 100 bp]
          -db [PROTEIN-DB], --proteindb [PROTEIN-DB]
                                BLAST protein database FASTA file to use for checking
                                the Prokka gene prediction
          -k [K], --kmers [K]   Choose k to calculate kmer frequencies
          -q, --quast           Run QUAST with unmapped regions against reference
                                assembly
          -c [BAMFILE], --coverage [BAMFILE]
                                Run SAMtools bedcov to look at short-read coverage in
                                the missing regions. Needs alignment of reads to the
                                reference genome in BAM format
        
          ```
        
        First, Mauve performs an alignment of both genomes with the progressiveMauve algorithm. It will generate a subdirectory prefix.alignment with several output files but most importantly the backbone file with coordinates of the mapped and unmapped regions in the reference genome.
        
        Afterwards, this script will parse the backbone file and extract the sequences that are not covered in the short-read assembly from the reference genome. They are written to a multi-fasta file with the prefix and coordinates in the headers, which is done equally for the mapped and conflict regions (regions that didn't map correctly due to gaps or indels). Two tab-delimited summary files are generated in a subdirectory called summary. One for the reference, with the amount of gapped and ungapped regions, the fraction of the reference genome that they represent, the GC content and the length. The other one for the unmapped regions, with for each region the GC content and length and then for each amino acid the occurence frequency averaged over all 6 reading frames. As an optional input, the user can add flanking regions to the extracted missing regions.
        
        Finally, SASpector will predict genes that are in the missing regions using Prokka and if a protein FASTA file database is provided, SASpector will BLAST the output sequences from Prokka to the database generating a tab-delimited summary with the hits of the sequences. You can use our defined database `saspector_proteindb.fasta`.
        
        As optional analysis:
        
        - kmer analysis and tandem repeats: if a kmer size is provided, SASpector will calculate the frequency of the kmers per missing regions and will generate summary tables and barplots for those kmers. Additionally, it will run Tandem Repeats Finder and will generate HTML reports for the missing regions with tandem repeats. Finally, SASpector will perform a pairwise comparison between kmers of missing regions and mapped regions (k-size = 31) for comparative studies, using sourmash.
        
        - Coverage analysis: if a BAM file is provided, SASpector will calculate the average coverage of the missing and the mapped regions, using SAMtools. It will generate a sorted BAM file and tab-delimited reports of the coverage for both regions.
        
        - QUAST: SASpector will run QUAST for the missing regions against the reference genome for genome quality assessment and will provide Icarus as genome viewer.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Before running SASpector, be sure to have your reference genome as a single FASTA file not a multi-FASTA file. If your reference genome is a multi-FASTA file (e.g. output from Unicycler), you can concatenate your sequences using Union command by EMBOSS.
        
        ```
        SASpector [Reference genome].fasta [Contigs].fasta -p [Genome ID] -dir [Output directory] -f [Length] -db [Protein database].fasta -k [kmer size] -c [reference genome].bam -q
        
        ```
